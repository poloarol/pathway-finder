Description: # pathway-finder
        
        
        A Genomic Mining Tool which connects to the GenBank database via the NCBI Utils API. 
        Using a queried gene, it builds a genomic pathway +/- bp around it and performs a blast to
        find identical genes with the provided similarity ratio (Uses the Edit/Levenshtein ratio).
        Finally it outputs the list of GenBank files (abc.gb) containing the various pathways.
        
        # Installation
        
        To install this program, PIP can be used as follows:
        
        pip install pathway-finder
        
        
        # Accessing the data
        
        For now all the program only supports request over the E-UTILS web interface of blast. The 
        programs bottleneck is the online blast. With an API key, 10 request can be done before pausing
        the script for 3 seconds, but when lacking it only 3 request can be done.
        
        A local version is under developement which would reduce this bottleneck and therefore increase
        the speed of the program, but will require about 120GB of available space on the workstation.
